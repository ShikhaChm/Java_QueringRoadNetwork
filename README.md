## Objective

This is my masters thesis work. This project work is about using historical query results to answer new (range and point)queries. Using the previously stored query results the new query results can be proccessed at a significantly fast rate. 
I used KD-trees structure to store the result of previous query results and for new queries the results is fetched from this structure.
